The amount of web-based information available has increased dramatically. How to gather useful information from the web has become a challenging issue for users. Current web information gathering systems attempt to satisfy user requirements by capturing their information needs. For this purpose, user profiles are created for user background knowledge description .User profiles represent the concept models possessed by users when gathering web information. 
A concept model is implicitly possessed by users and is generated from their background knowledge. While this concept model cannot be proven in laboratories, many web ontologists have observed it in user behaviour. When users read through a document, they can easily determine whether or not it is of their interest or relevance to them, a judgment that arisesfrom their implicit concept models. If a user’s concept model can be simulated, then a superior representation of user profiles can be built.
